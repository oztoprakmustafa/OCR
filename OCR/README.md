Optical Character Recognition(OCR) is the mechanical  or electrical conversion of images of typewritten or printed text into machine-encoded text. It is widely used as a form of data entry from printed paper data records, whether passport documents, invoices, bank statements, computerized receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation. It is a common method of digitizing printed texts so that it can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as machine translation, text-to-speech, key data and text mining. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision.

### *Algorithm*:

-------------
Every optical image when converted into grey scale can be considered as a matrix with 1’s and 0’s as its elements. The theory behind this optical character recognition is division of the image into suitable number of pixels which represent the element of the matrix as stated above and comparing these pixels with those of pre-defined set of templates. For a single character , it  can be directly compared with templates  whereas for a word which consists of several characters it is primarily divided into  group of clusters each consisting of a single character which is compared with the given templates.

### *Usage*:

-------------
Run alphabet.m file to load capture an image with the webcam and recognise the text in it.
